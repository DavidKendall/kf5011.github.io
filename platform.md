# Development platform

The [Atom](http://atom.io) editor is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac's.  By itself it has good support for programming.   The plugin/extension [PlatformIO](http://platformIO.org) adds specific support for embedded systems.  These make a good pairing, are freely available (Open-source), and I've successfully build code for the current ARM boards (as long as you avoid the Embedded artists library `EALib`), and Arduino Uno.  Using both C and assembly language.

# Github
I plan to use Github for disseminating material (code examples) to the students.  Getting them used to using version control as a matter of routine.  The  Github classrooms provide a very convenient way of handling submission of software projects.
