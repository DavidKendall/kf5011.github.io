The seminar sessions form the core of the practical work in this module.  We will be using the FRDM-K64F ARM based platform.  The practical work will have two themes, one based on the MBED libraries and abstractions, the other based on a pure C clean room implementation.

The MBED libraries are written in C++ and are a generic set of functions that abstract out the behaviour of supported devices.  The device vendor provides an implementation of the routines on their device.
