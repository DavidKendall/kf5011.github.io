### Analogue-to-Digital Convertor (ADC)
The Board has two [potentiometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer) (Analogue inputs).  These can be read using the [ADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter) (Analogue-Digital-Convertor).

The repository [s3.1](https://github.com/kf5011/s3.1) illustrates how these can be read.

The output from the [library is scaled into a 0…1 range](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/reference/analogin.html).  
We can recover the actual value read using a knowledge of the hardware that generated the signal.

1. The potentiometers are connected between 0V and 3.3V, the slider is the input to the ADC.  
  * Thus the input voltage to the ADC will be between 0V and 3.3V.
2.  The ADC reference voltage is 3.3V.
  * The ADC reads 0 for 0V and 1.0f for 3.3V
3. The ADC uses 16 bits for the conversion.

<section class="question">
1. Rewrite the code to display the read voltage
2. How small a voltage change can the ADC read?  The full scale 0…3.3V is quantised into 16bits `0x0000`…`0xFFFF`.
3. What angle does this correspond to for the potentiometer?   If we wanted to measure angles?

### Analogue Output -- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
One form of Analogue output is Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM).  This is often used for motor speed control or as a _dimmer_ mode for controlling LEDs.

Repository [s3.2](https://github.com/kf5011/s3.2/) shows an example of PWM used to control an LED's brightness.
