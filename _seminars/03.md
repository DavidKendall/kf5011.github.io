### Analogue-to-Digital Convertor (ADC)
The Board has two [potentiometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer) (Analogue inputs).  These can be read using the [ADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter) (Analogue-Digital-Convertor).

The repository [s3.1](https://github.com/kf5011/s3.1) illustrates how these can be read.

The output from the [library is scaled into a 0…1 range](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/reference/analogin.html).  
We can recover the actual value read using a knowledge of the hardware that generated the signal.

1. The potentiometers are connected between 0V and 3.3V, the slider is the input to the ADC.  
  * Thus the input voltage to the ADC will be between 0V and 3.3V.
2.  The ADC reference voltage is 3.3V.
  * The ADC reads 0 for 0V and 1.0f for 3.3V
3. The ADC uses 16 bits for the conversion.

<section class="question">
1. Rewrite the code to display the read voltage
2. How small a voltage change can the ADC read?  The full scale 0…3.3V is quantised into 16bits `0x0000`…`0xFFFF`.
3. What angle does this correspond to for the potentiometer?   If we wanted to measure angles?

### Analogue Output --- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
One form of Analogue output is Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM).  This is often used for motor speed control or as a _dimmer_ mode for controlling LEDs.

Repository [s3.2](https://github.com/kf5011/s3.2/) shows an example of PWM used to control an LED's brightness.

The example uses a simple ramp
```c
        for( duty=0 ; duty<1.0 ; duty+=0.01 ) {
            red.write(duty);
            wait_ms(100);
        }
```    

A more complex algorithm uses:
```c
        for( duty=0 ; duty<4.6 ; duty+=0.23 ) {
            float brightness = exp(duty)/100;
            red.write(brightness);
            wait_ms(100);
        }
```

What do you observe as different about the two effects
[ *[hint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law)* ]?  
(you may want to play about with the delays and values)

 * What value do you need to write for the LED to be?
   - fully on?
   - off?
   - dim (about quarter brightness)
   - bright (about three-quarter brightness)
 {: .question}

<section class="question">
Play about with different functions to control the brightness
* [Sawtooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave) _really just the ramp I used earlier_
* [Triangle wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave) _a two sided ramp, ramp up and ramp down_
* [Sine wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave) _smoother at the extremes_, Can you tell it is smoother?
</section>

* Use the input from one of the Potentiometers to set the brightness of an LED.
* Use both potentiometers to mix RED and GREEN LED colours.  
  What range of colours can be displayed?
{:.question}

<section class="question">
Only the Red and Green LED on the application shield can be controlled using a PWM output.  
 - Why is this?
 - Is there any way of controlling the Blue LED on the application shield in this way?
 - If the Blue LED could be controlled to set its brightness, what range of colours could be displayed?

### Analogue Output --- Frequency Output
We can use the PWM output in another way for another form of analogue output.
Here we are going to use a fixed 50% duty cycle, equal times on and off.
We will vary the period (total time of on and off).

Example [s3.3](https://github.com/kf5011/s3.3) scans through a frequency range.
```c
        for (f=20.0; f<20.0e3; f+=100) {
            speaker.period(1.0/f);
            ...
        }
```
* what period corresponds to 20Hz?
* what periof corresponds to 20kHz?
{:.question}

What are the lowest and highest frequencies you can hear?

<section class="exercise">
Look at the table of [piano note frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies). 

* How would you map a note to a frequency to apply to the speaker?
* What data structure would you use to handle a note's tone and duration?
* How would you play Music on the Speaker?
