# You Will need

For this module you will need access to several online services.  These are free and easy to sign up to.  If you don't already have accounts you should sign up for one as soon as possible.

# GitHub
We will be using [git](https://git-scm.com/) as our version control system.  Example code, exercises, and assignment will use [GitHub](https://github.com/)
as the master store for the repositories.

> A GitHub account will be __*essential*__ for submitting the code for your assignment.

## Github Education
Once you have your Github account, it is well worth signing up for a [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).  There are plenty of useful resources, and you get more private repositories for your account.

# PlatformIO Plus
We're using [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) as our development platform for the K64F boards.  A PlatformIO Plus Basic account will allow you access to the PlatformIO debugger from with the development environment.

Once you have an account you can  request a free license of PIO Plus, by sending "ISIC card or similar doc for "student" confirmation" to [support@pioplus.com](support@pioplus.com).
