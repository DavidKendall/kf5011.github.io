# Course structure
We have a 12 week semester, with 2 hours of lectures and 2 hours of labs each week.  Based on feedback from the current students I'm going for a 2hour long lab session, and 2 seperate 1 hour lectures.

Having skimmed through [Lee & Varaiya](http://leevaraiya.org/) and [Lee & Seshia](http://leeseshia.org/) I'm thinking there is a good opportunity to make the lectures more theoretical that the previous module.   This would push more into the practical sessions.  There is good scope for putting a lot of directed reading to support both lectures and practicals.

## Some things to Cover
