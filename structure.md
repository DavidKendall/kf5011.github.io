# Course structure
We have a 12 week semester, with 2 hours of lectures and 2 hours of labs each week.  Based on feedback from the current students I'm going for a 2hour long lab session, and 2 seperate 1 hour lectures.

Having skimmed through [Lee & Varaiya](http://leevaraiya.org/) and [Lee & Seshia](http://leeseshia.org/) I'm thinking there is a good opportunity to make the lectures more theoretical that the previous module.   This would push more into the practical sessions.  There is good scope for putting a lot of directed reading to support both lectures and practicals.

## Some things to Cover
* **Device drivers** Low level access and control of devices, GPIO, configuring
* **Interrupts** Interrupt handlers, timers, rising/falling edge buttons
* **TCP/IP stack, OSI model** physical layer, link layer, and application layer
* **Data formats** YAML, JSON, XML
* **Data logging websites** api, data analytics
* **Digital Signals**
* **Analog Signals**
* **Sampling** Nyquist limit

## A  weekly plan
How does this look as a plan?
It may want some revision in the light of Lee & Varaiya, and Lee & Seshia.
