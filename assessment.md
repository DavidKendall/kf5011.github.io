# Assessment strategy

I liked the assessment strategy that  Dr Kevin Jacques (Lincoln) presented at the away day.  It is the kind of style of assessment I'd like to move towards, especially as the student numbers are going skywards.

# (draft) Learning Outcomes

## Knowledge & Understanding:
1.	Demonstrate knowledge and critical understanding of the interaction between physical systems, computer hardware and software, including network protocols and control theories
2.	Apply essential principles of design and implementation of stack models, such as the TCP/IP protocol stack

## Intellectual / Professional skills & abilities:
3.	Design, implement, test, document and evaluate a networked embedded control system
4.	Apply software development tools and best practice to produce, test and debug software for small networked control systems using specifications for embedded devices and associated hardware

## Criterion
We have to break the learning outcomes down into the fine grained assessed criteria, then for each one write a statement of what constitutes a 3rd, 2:2, 2:1, and 1st demonstration of that criteria.

| LO | Criteria | 3 | 2:2 | 2:1 | 1 |
|----|----------|---|-----|-----|---|
| 1  | this     |   |     |     |   |
