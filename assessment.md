# Assessment strategy

I liked the assessment strategy that  Dr Kevin Jacques (Lincoln) presented at the away day.  It is the kind of style of assessment I'd like to move towards, especially as the student numbers are going skywards.

## from the module descriptor
### Formative assessment and feedback
Formative assessment will take the form of exercises in the practical classes to help you apply theory and to check your understanding. Your tutors will comment on your progress and make suggestions for improvement.

### Summative assessment
Summative assessment is by a portfolio assignment covering the development of a complex networked control system, including elements such as; input, output, feedback loops, networking, data logging, and security. It will assess all of the moduleâ€™s MLOs.

Students will be given written and oral feedback which they can feed forward into other modules.

## Assessment format
Experience with Small Embedded Systems has found that students like the practical assignment, and aren't fond of reports (much like myself).

I propose to use a practical assignment as the main focus, and if necessary look at using the automatically marked questions in blackboard.


# Learning Outcomes

## Knowledge & Understanding:
1.	Demonstrate knowledge and critical understanding of the interaction between physical systems, computer hardware and software, including control theories, network protocols, and cybersecurity architecture and operations
2.	Apply principles of design and implementation of stack models, network protocols, control systems, and security

## Intellectual / Professional skills & abilities:
3.	Design, implement, test, document and evaluate a networked embedded control system
4.	Apply software development tools and best practice to produce, test and debug software for small networked control systems using specifications for embedded devices and associated hardware

## Personal Values Attributes (Global / Cultural awareness, Ethics, Curiosity) (PVA):
5. Demonstrate independent, critical and reflective thinking and practice in the development of a networked control system, and engagement with appropriate professional and technical literature to support and communicate such development

## Criterion
We have to break the learning outcomes down into the fine grained assessed criteria, then for each one write a statement of what constitutes a 3rd, 2:2, 2:1, and 1st demonstration of that criteria.

| LO | Criteria | 3 | 2:2 | 2:1 | 1 |
|----|----------|---|-----|-----|---|
| 1  | this     |   |     |     |   |
