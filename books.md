# Reading list
Some suggested texts:

* Lee & Varaiya _Structure and Interpretation of Signals and Systems_ [http://leevaraiya.org/](http://leevaraiya.org/)
* Lee & Seshia _Introduction to Embedded Systems_ [http://leeseshia.org/](http://leeseshia.org/)

Both books are available from their websites as PDFs (though it is nice having a hard-copy in hand [ludite that I am])

Also some O'Reilly books I've found useful

* Catsoulis _Designing Embedded Hardware_.  Good for material on the electronic interfacing side.
* Barr & Massa _Programming Embedded Systems_.  Based on using the GNU toolset
* White _Making Embedded Systems_.  Covers some more general aspects, state-machines etc.

The O'Reilly texts go with AVR (Arduino Uno) or other low cost systems, so we may have to be selective.
