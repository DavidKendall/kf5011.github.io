## Question 5:   What material from small embedded systems and computer networks must I keep in

* small embedded systems -
 1. Keep in the assembly language. But maybe a little less of it...
 2. Keep the games aspect as it makes it more enjoyable.
 3. overall practical and lectures were good. Don't tweak too much..

* keep in coordinate gemoetry triangles ect.

* Assembly code stuff

* All should be kept.

* The contents of the pong assignment

* The introduction to development using Github Classroom has been a particularly rewarding experience for me. At the beginning of the year I had no idea how to use Github. I am now quite confident and am pulling/pushing/merging at will! I am aware that not all student will feel the same way about the use of Github but I feel it would be of benefit to future students if this practice is continued and refined further. Particularly I believe student would benefit from being encouraged to learn the ease with which they can sync their work across a number of devices using the command line Git tools that we were introduced to.


## Question 6: What material from small embedded systems and computer networks should I not keep

* The first three weeks of making the leds flicker, maybe condense it into a week

* first modal of pong was very easy

* _computer networks..._ i was not a very big fan of... i don't enjoy networking and it is such a niche part for what most people want to do... For me the module was a good standard and i scored very highly in it... The module was one of the stronger ones.. but i don't feel its very useful to me overall

* so its a case  of ditching the module as its  not wanted/needed  or keep it as its overall a good module

* Maybe the assignment brief could have been made more clear

* a different approach to computer networking... as binary was addressed to much and confused a lot of the class

* Small embedded systems was a good module and just some of the assembler code could be taken out in my opinion.

* All should be kept.

## Question 7: Is there anything that isn't currently in the module that I should have in the new module.

* Making boards interact with one another

* nothing i can think of for computer networks....

* For small embedded systems... change assignment to actually have a fully functioning game or product to make it more of a finished piece.

* more workshops in structs and pointers would have been good as theses are the hardest parts of the languauge...

* in conclusion... LESS ASSEMBLER and MORE POINTERS? that would have helped me as i never touched C before this module

* We spent quite a bit of time studying Assembly in the second semester. It was a little disappointing that we did not have the opportunity to 'test' our learning to a greater degree in the final assesment.

* An assignment more based on assembly code

* Give more help for maths and coordinates, optional top up classes for triangles and coordinates.

* It would be good for others to be able to build very basic circuits and use soldering irons. This could be done by a simple flashing LED project worth 5% or something.
