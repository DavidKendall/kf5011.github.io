## numbering convention
Lectures are numbered 01, 02,â€¦  this is roughly aligned with the weeks in the semester, but it isn't a fixed mapping.

The .1, .2, sub-number indicates which of the two lectures the notes are for.

Roughly split into 2 interweaving streams,
 will try to keep step with labs (no promises)
