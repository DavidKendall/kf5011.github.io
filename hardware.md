# Storage
For storage of the board I use a "Really Useful Box, 0.2litre" box.
They are quite common, some (online options are)
 * [staples](http://www.staples.co.uk/0-2-litre-box-clear/cbs/297704891.html)
 * [maplin](https://www.maplin.co.uk/p/really-useful-02l-box-5-pack-n65fl)
 * [hobycraft](http://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/really-useful-clear-box-02-litres/571333-1000)
 * [amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Really-Useful-Boxes-Rectangle-Box/dp/B001F67NJ4)

Or just find a shop and buy one.

# Windows 10 Fix
Windows 10 seems to mess with the board reset.  The problem lies in that Windows is trying to write drive house-keeping data to the virtual usb drive that appears as "MBED" (folders like _System Volume Information_).

Looking through various forums, this looks like a common complaint.
Most of the recommended solutions to turn off this feature involve setting a registry-key **DisableAutomaticRemovableDriveIndexing** to 1.

I didn't have any success with that, but the following comment I found in one discussion fixed the issue.  I now have my version of Windows 10 playing nicely with the board. (http://disq.us/p/15vrugs)
> In recent versions of Windows 10, as well as the above, you need to stop the Storage Service too (type Services into the start menu to find the management applet)

# If you do something silly
> Like press the reset button while running a debugger.

And end up with the red and green lights stuck on (need to detail the process)
