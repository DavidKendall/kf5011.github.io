Assignment Brief --- Lunar Lander

Provide: jar file -- local server on port nn
	recieves json/yaml data as control signals
	returns  update of position and sensor readings (Radar range etc)

Task:
Write two programs:
 * Embeded system of K64F using switches and acellerometer/joystick as inputs
   Some status on display and leds (contact/warning)
 * Server/bridge - a GUI showing more information
   - Sends control signals to server in 1, interprets data recieved
   - Serial comms to embedded, custom student designed protocol over USB/Serial.

Deliverables:
	- embedded/pc protocol
	- embedded sw
	- pc sw

Marking:
	Criterion based cf. Dr Kevin Jacques  (Lincoln) , cf. Dan Hodgson
	

LEM:
	Physics Server: 
		written in Java(Processing), run as a jar file
		System is 2D (Easy to handle for ground and graphics)
		Implements physics and trajectory, models ground and impact!
		(use processing for noise based ground height)

	Mode 1: inputs :
			thrusters - rotation and minor translation
			main engine - throttle setting 

	Outputs:
		(x,y,r) tripple for state
		rate of change for state
		altitude - radar range above ground

	Mode 2:
		ouput: Synthetic appature scan (ground profile)
		array of heights for Â±x
